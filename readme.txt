This allows you to import a list of users taken from an uploaded CSV file.

== Description ==

This allows you to import a list of users taken from an uploaded CSV file. It will add users with basic information, including username, surname and email address. Each user will get the default amin role.

There are no additional options available at the moment, but if you want to add a bunch of users in one go, this will do it for you quickly.

Suggestions are more than welcome through the forum for the plugin.

1. Upload `csv-user-import` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. You will see a new 'Import Users' option under the existing 'Users' menu area.
